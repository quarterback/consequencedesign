  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#C0392B]">What is Consequence Design?</h2>
  <p class="mt-4">
    Consequence Design is a way of tracing how systems behave once deployed. It maps the unintended, invisible, and downstream effects of infrastructure, tools, and institutions—especially when friction is removed or context is lost.
    It isn’t just a critique of technology. It’s a lens for understanding how simulation-native systems shape trust, participation, and the erosion of public meaning.

<!-- Origins -->
<section class="mb-10">
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#C0392B]">Origins</h2>
  <p class="mt-4">
    This work began as an attempt to name the patterns behind interface collapse and institutional degradation. What started as interaction mapping evolved into a broader theory of how legitimacy is manufactured through dashboards, defaults, and systems that appear neutral while quietly reorganizing power.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-2">
    Consequence Design emerged as a response to acceleration without accountability. It now serves as both a framing device and a design ethic.

<!-- About Me -->
<section class="mb-10">
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#C0392B]">About Me</h2>
  <p class="mt-4">
    I’m <strong>Ron Bronson</strong>—an interaction engineer, strategist, and theorist working at the intersection of complexity, public systems, and institutional foresight.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-2">
    I’ve led design and strategy teams inside government, taught design in urban planning programs, and worked across AI policy, service design, and systems transformation. My background includes roles at federal digital agencies, state governments, and civic tech collectives.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-2">
    Consequence Design is the conceptual backbone of my research, consulting, and teaching. It connects the dots between how things are built, how they fail, and what they leave behind.

<!-- Core Ideas -->
<section class="mb-10">
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#C0392B]">Core Ideas</h2>
  <ul class="mt-4 space-y-4">
    <li>
      <strong>Second-Order Effects:</strong> Most systems are designed with narrow goals. The deeper impacts—the ones that ripple, accumulate, or distort—often go unmeasured and unaddressed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Administrative Aesthetics:</strong> Legitimacy is increasingly projected through dashboards, performance metrics, and “neutral” interfaces. Governance becomes simulation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Parasitarchy:</strong> Institutions can be hollowed out and repurposed, retaining the form of function while becoming tools of extraction or illusion.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Friction as Signal:</strong> Friction isn’t failure—it’s information. Smoothness often masks harm, while obstacles can reveal where systems truly operate.
    </li>
  </ul>

<!-- Evolution -->
<section class="mb-10">
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#C0392B]">Where It’s Going</h2>
  <p class="mt-4">
    Consequence Design has grown into a foundation for applied theory and critical practice. It now supports my writing, keynotes, and advising work across sectors—public and private, global and local.
